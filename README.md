# Replicode

Replicode is the programing language of AERA (Auto-catalytic Endogenous Reflective Architecture)

This README file documents general information about Replicode.

See the file [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for build and install instructions.

See the file [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for version numbers and changes.

## code structure
The main program execution for the example happens in AERA/main.cpp
- `main()` // loads the `settings.xml` and the seed image, starts up `r_exec/mem.cpp` and then waits for run_time and ends by saving the results to disk to `decompiled.txt`
- `r_exec/mem.cpp` starts up the `runReductionCore` and the `runTimeCore` threads which do the magic
- The `r_exec/pattern_extractor.cpp` and `r_exec/g_monitor.cpp` push new reduction and time jobs to the job queues
- The `r_exec/*_controller.cpp` are the controllers for mdl, pgm and more
- The commands (`cmd`) activated in the replicode scripts would be activated through `r_exec/mem.cpp::eject(Code *command)`, see https://github.com/IIIM-IS/Integration_OpenAI for actual device commands

## Gotchas

This is a list of unintuitive issues with using Replicode, to help new users.

* Only the `AERA/replicode_v1.2` examples really function due to syntax changes.
* The term "set" is used even when it means an ordered array with repeated elements.
* The term "hlp" just means "mdl" or "cst", which use similar structures for "high-level pattern".
* Every object definition ends with a propagation of saliency threshold (psln_thr), usually 1.
  For brevity, the documentation often omits it. And there is a macro in std.replicode which allows it to be
  omitted from the definitions in there. But it must be included when you write code.
* "icmd" means "internal command", not "instantiated command" (like "imdl" for "instantiated model").
* imdl set of exposed values doesn't have LHS fact timestamps. See: HLPBindingMap::build_f_ihlp:1037
* If a model's guard assigns a variable, the value passed in with the same template variable is ignored.
* The timestamps of facts defined at the top level automatically have the start time added for run time 
  (and subtracted after run time for `decompiled_objects.txt`).
* min_sim_time_horizon is really "time allowance for the simulated predictions".
* Need CSTController::inject_goal:461 new View resilience 9999 to keep goal commands until used.
* OIDs are not in order of creation. (Only order of binding to a view.)
* Program "guards" which check boolean constraints are different than model "guards" which assign values to variables.
* `pong.2.simplified.replicode`: Prediction is made after the actual fact is injected. (But the prediction doesn't look at it,
  and the prediction check uses the output of auto focus which correctly doesn't appear until the next frame.)
* For external cmd, need a program to intercept (fact (goal (fact (cmd ...)))) and eject the cmd.
  Such a goal abduced from a mdl is put in primary, so the program must be instantiated in primary.
  [Maybe not in primary. Need to understand how simulated goals are committed, and to which group.]
* Prediction failures may come from false assumptions. In `settings.xml`, try `enable_assumptions="no"` .
* Objects with a short resilience aren't in `decompiled_objects.txt`. In `settings.xml`, try `keep_invalidated_objects=yes` .
* Math operations on two floating point numbers produce a floating point number, as expected. And addition
  and subtraction of two time values produces a time value, as expected. But the result of operations with
  mixed types is not obvious. Below 'nb' is a floating-point number and 'us' is a 64-bit timestamp in microseconds.
  - (+ nb us) -> us
  - (+ us nb) -> us
  - (- nb us) not allowed
  - (- us nb) -> us
  - (* nb us) -> nb
  - (* us nb) -> us ... different than (* nb us)!
  - (* us us) -> nb ... counter-intuitive
  - (/ nb us) -> nb
  - (/ us nb) -> us
  - (/ us us) -> nb
