; There are 5 objects in this example: a small cube and a large cube (training objects), a large cylinder and a small sphere and a large sphere (test objects).
; The example is composed of two phases: training and test phases. The agent is trained in the training phase and its knowledge transfer
;    is tested in the test phase.
; Training: The AERA agent learns prior information by performing experminents via grasping abd releasing the small and the large cubes.
; Test phase: When the drives are injected, it must modify the prior knolwedge and generate new knowledge in the form of CST-REQs that is 
;    useful for grasping and/or releasing the test objects (the small cylinder and the large sphere).
; Three drives are injected during the test phase: h holding [cyl], h holding [], and h holding [s].
