<!--Usage
Init
  base_period: in us.
  reduction_core_count: number of threads processing reduction jobs.
  time_core_count: number of thread processing update jobs.
  (If reduction_core_count and time_core_count are zero, then run in "diagnostic time". See:
   https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/30 )
System
  mdl_inertia_sr_thr: in [0,1].
  mdl_inertia_cnt_thr: in instance count.
  tpx_dsr_thr: in [0,1].
  min_sim_time_horizon: in us.
  max_sim_time_horizon: in us.
  sim_time_horizon_factor: in [0,1]: factor of (before-now) allocated to simulation.
  tpx_time_horizon: in us.
  perf_sampling_prd: in us.
  float_tolerance: in [0,1].
  time_tolerance: in us.
  primary_thz: time after which states/models that did not match are pushed down to secondary group (models) or sent to oblivion (states); in seconds.
  secondary_thz: time after which states/models that did not match are sent to oblivion; in seconds.
Debug
  debug_windows: The number of debug windows to show created models. (Not to be confused with the runtime output below.)
  runtime_output_file_path: The file path for the runtime output of the trace_levels selected below. If "" then use std::cout.
  trace_levels: Hexadecimal ORed values of traces for the runtime output (numbers indicate the location from right to left):
    0: cst inputs, 1: cst outputs, 2: mdl inputs, 3: mdl outputs, 4 prediction monitoring, 5: goal monitoring,
      6: model revision, 7:mdl/cst injections, 8: I/O device injections/ejections, 9: auto focus.
    e.g.: 3 means cst inputs and cst outputs, ignore others. FFFF enables all trace levels.
  Resilience
    ntf_mk_resilience: in upr (i.e. relative to the ntf group).
    goal_pred_success_resilience: in upr (i.e. relative to the ntf group).
  Objects
    get_objects: yes or no.
      If yes, then after the Mem shuts down the image will contain all valid objects, or all valid and invalid
        objects if keep_invalidated_objects is also yes.
      If no, ignore the rest of this section.
    keep_invalidated_objects: yes or no; if yes, the image will contain all valid and invalidated objects after 
      the Mem shuts down. Use with caution: Invalidated objects are not deleted at run-time, which can consume memory.
    decompile_objects: yes or no.
    decompile_to_file: yes or no.
    decompilation_file_path: The path of the decompiled output file if decompile_to_file is yes
    ignore_named_objects: yes or no; if yes, objects provided by the deveoper are not decompiled.
    write_objects: yes or no.
    objects_path: The path of the image file if write_objects is yes.
    test_objects: yes or no (yes: reads back and decompiles).
Run
  run_time: in ms.
  probe_level: any probe set to a level >= this level will not be executed. 0 means no probe will be executed.
  enable_assumptions: yes or no to enable injecting assumptions.
  Models
    same as for Debug/Objects.
