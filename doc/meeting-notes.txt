* DONE. pong.discrete.cmd.external: Why does m_y0_plus prediction fail?
  InputLessPGMOverlay::inject_productions:459 injects a (fact (cmd) ...) of zero duration.
  This is used as input to cst_y2_minus instead of the one injected by pgm_cmd_move_y_minus.
  BindingMap::match_timings:712 reduces (fact (icst cst_y2_minus)) to zero duration to match it.
  This makes the (fact (imdl m_y2_minus)) zero duration also.
  Therefore the prediction from the RHS of the model is also zero duration.
    (fact (pred (fact (mk.val p1 position y1 :) 0s:600ms:0us 0s:600ms:0us) ::) ::)
  The PMonitor calls _Fact::match_timings_overlap which fails if no overlap.
  Possible solutions:
    * NO: Make mdl ignore LHS duration and predict RHS with explicit duration. (Requires changing pattern extractor)
	* NO: Make inject_productions offset the instantaneous (fact (cmd ...)) into the future.
	* YES: Make inject_productions give (fact (cmd ...)) a duration.
	* NO: Move responsibility to inject (fact (cmd ...)) from inject_productions to the external environment.
	* NO: In _Fact::match_timings_overlap, special case when one interval is zero duration.
* DONE. Is the failed prediction from the assumption shielded from decreasing mdl confidence? No.

  Feb 2012: Major update to CSTController::reduce
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/commit/3c5b9be5f935d6783fb1d35d74ca7d19ad4be186#diff-0ff725f0ae881cefbad0064fc2eac950R236
  Changed:
    Code *target = goal->get_reference(0)->get_reference(0);
	if (target->code(0).asOpcode() == Opcodes::ICST ...
  to:
    _Fact *goal_target=goal->get_reference(0);
	if (goal_target->code(0).asOpcode() == Opcodes::ICst ...
  There is a missing get_reference(0), so it never matches.
  Also, the following is clearly a bug, using the uninitialized bm:
    P<BindingMap> bm = new BindingMap(bm);
  Thus, the code to create goals from an abduced icst never ran after Feb 2012.
* DONE. HLPBindingMap::init_from_f_ihlp:1011 Fix to get the time stamp structure.
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/46
* Need CSTController::inject_goal:449 new View saliency 9999
  How does AERA choose among possible actions?

2020-01-17
* DONE. Make a pull request for the fix to CSTController::reduce. Merged.
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/47
* DONE. What was CSTController::inject_goal:449 resilience before the "big commmit" Feb 2012?
  There is code to compute the resilience, but seems to always use 1.
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/blob/8260dc91c441c5b586663332741bd85242f3d2d9/r_exec/cst_controller.cpp#L92
  Should we try to use the duration until the goal's fact time stamp?
* DONE. In drive for y1 200ms later, why does it also eject cmd move_y_minus?
  Because extra move commands are ignored, but registered anyway, did a model learn wrongly from that? NO.
  The goal for (mk.val p1 position y1) also matches m_y2_minus, and cst_y2_minus
    abduces the goal (cmd move_y_minus [p1] :), even though position is not y2.
* DONE. Is replicode now making simulations?
  NO. In settings.xml, min_sim_time_horizon==max_sim_time_horizon==0.
  Will change max_sim_time_horizon.
* pong.2.goal.replicode model building.
  ASTController<U>::ASTController:89 target is the premise, i.e. the tpx' target to be "defeated".
  Fix typo in comment: https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/commit/cde840d45a73c2826f7564d8a41b2732ed2ea88f
  CTPX::find_guard_builder "5 forms"
  InputLessPGMOverlay::inject_productions:461 Add GetTimeTolerance or use SYNC_HOLD so it can be a cause.

2020-01-21
* DONE pong.2.goal.replicode: Why does it need the initial speed_y?
  Because the patterns extractor CTPX::reduce needs a "cause", and this is the only fact available.
* CTPX::reduce: Discard inputs that don't share values with the consequent OR target.
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/48

2020-01-28
* DONE. Added "glue" output, e.g.
  fact (4652) imdl mdl 106 matches evidence fact (3962) imdl mdl 106
* Wrong: fact_130:(fact (icst cst_105 |[] [p1 y1 y1]) 0s:600ms:0us 0s:700ms:0us)
  Starts from consequent (fact y1_is_a_discrete_position1 0s:600ms:0us 0s:700ms:0us)

2020-01-31
* DONE. Finish gotcha: Documentation omits the 1 at the end of every object definition.
* CSTController::reduce:380 should ++o ? https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/commit/fc5961a4fa9f44d40298381bbdf86f314a9f26ab#diff-0ff725f0ae881cefbad0064fc2eac950R318
* DONE: pong.discrete.cmd.external: When adding fact 119 to fact_127, why is patterns already down to 2 used members?
    Because CSTOverlay::get_offspring transfers(?) from patterns to inputs.
  When building fact 113 icst[96][ 102 108 109 111], why does it use all 4 inputs?
    Because it comes from CSTOverlay(1331) which was never an offspring.
    Why no prediction? Because job 466 deletes model 98, so fact_113 is not used.

2020-02-07
* DONE. Create pull request for CSTController::reduce:380 should ++o
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/49
* DEFER. Does replicode v1.1 instantiate a cst from partial inputs?
  Don't know. The code is too different, and can't find tests that use pattern extractor.
* DONE. Make pong.discrete.cmd.external build the same models in diagnostic time.
  CSTOverlay::reduce:277 if (inputs.size() == original_patterns_size) inject_production();
  Almost: mdl 122 makes unbound predictions, e.g. fact_171
* Does pong.discrete.cmd.external use the learned models to abduce from the drive?
  NO. PrimaryMDLController::abduce:1609 abduction_allowed(bm) == false
  Maybe partly due to the bug in scan_variable: https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/50

2020-02-13

* DONE. Review and merge https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/53 .
* DONE. In hand-coded model, why doesn't it (goal (fact (imdl)))?
  PrimaryMDLController::abduce:1636 retrieve_imdl_bwd returns NO_R (no requirements)
    -> directly to abduce LHS
  For mdl_98 from CTPX, MDLController constructor sets _is_requirement=WR (weak requirement)
* OK. Review issue to rename for readability https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/issues/55

* DONE. Merge pull request for readability issue https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/issues/55
* DONE. Review issue to remove unused parameter https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/issues/57
* Changes in pong.discrete.cmd.external to abduce a goal from learned models:
  * Still need pull request https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/48
  * Still need CSTOverlay::reduce:288 to require all inputs for an icst.
  * Offset (fact (cmd)) to allow it to be a cause. https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/59
  * Delay the drive to allow predicting the imdl as a requirement. https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/commit/3339d3a804a32d1692b993777d1da87d3035a787
  * In m_run_position, offset the timestamp of the goal position by 90000us 
    so that v2 in mdl_93 exactly matches 3s:200ms:0us in the requirement
	(imdl mdl_93 [y1 3s:100ms:0us 3s:200ms:0us] [p1 y2 v5]) .
	(Need to find a way to make this flexible.)
  * Force HLPBindingMap::match_bwd_timings to succeed.
    The requirement timestamps 3s:100ms:0us,3s:200ms:0us don't match
	the mdl_93 RHS backward timestamps 3s:200ms:0us,3s:300ms:0us .
	It works if we use the timestamps of f_pattern (the constructed imdl).
  * In HLPOverlay::check_fwd_timings:178, need to evaluate fwd_after
    "v4:(sub v2 0s:80ms:0us)" first because fwd_before 
	"v5:(add v4 0s:30ms:0us)" depends on it.
	In general, there may be dependencies among many guards, so the general solution
	needs multiple passes to bind other assignment variables that may be dependencies.
	Maybe do ScanBWDGuards first and let it bind variables?

2020-02-25

* DONE. pong.discrete.cmd.external: Increase to 10 positions.
* DONE. In unfixed pong.discrete.cmd.external, when the goal to achieve position y0 is not achieved,
  what does the goal monitor do?
  ANSWER: Makes |fact_845:(|fact (success fact_825 fact_832) ...)
    but no further reduction jobs process it.
* DONE. Is PTPX invoked when a prediction fails?
  ANSWER: Yes, but does nothing. PTPX::reduce needs inputs, but nothing adds them.
  Makes |fact_234:(|fact (success fact_226 fact_232) ...)
  std.replicode:166 Need to set ctpx_on true.
  settings.xml: Need to set tpx_time_horizon?
* DONE. Is GTPX invoked when drive goal succeeds?
  ANSWER: Yes, but does nothing. GTPX::reduce needs inputs, but AutoFocusController::reduce:392
    doesn't call dispatch becuase std.replicode:166 pass_through is true.
	Setting pass_through false: No auto focus, no learned models, no AutoFocus.goals. Still no dispatch.

* DONE. Merge pull request, need to increment iterator https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/53
* DONE. Is GMonitor::commit called?
  ANSWER: Yes, but sim_successes is empty because store_simulated_outcome is never called. 
  * It might be called from GMonitor::reduce but only after calling get_simulation(controller),
	which I can't believe was ever tested because it would crash due to the bug reported in
	https://github.com/IIIM-IS/CoreLibrary/pull/3 .
  * FIXED. Also, the code in store_similated_outcome never adds to sim_successes.optional_solutions . 
    _GMonitor::store_simulated_outcome:112
    (Hard to believe this code was tested.)
  * FIXED. Also, GMonitor::commit:217 uses (*sol).second, not best_sol. (Copy/paste error?)
  * MAYBE NOT A PROBLEM. Also, GMonitor::commit:219 may not use sim_successes.mandatory_solutions if there is no 
    best_sol from sim_successes.optional_solutions .

* DONE. Review/merge pull request for tabs to spaces https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/69

* DONE. Review merged pull request to rename to sim_time_horizon_factor https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/68
* Review/merge pull request for GMonitor sim_thz https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/70
* More simulation issues:
  * min_sim_time_horizon is really "time allowance for the simulated predictions". PMDLController::get_sim_thz:1118
  * In get_sim_thz, Sim::thz and _GMonitor::sim_thz, "time horizon" means only abduction w/o prediction (min_sim_thz).
  * TopLevelMDLController::abduce_lhs:1228 makes Sim where sim_thz already has subtracted min_sim_thz. Then,
    PrimaryMDLController::abduce:1623 divides this by 2 and subtracts min_sim_thz again.
  * GMonitor::commit:217 bindings belongs to top model, but abduce called on another model - mismatch.

* DONE. Merge pending pull requests into experimental side branch. Tell Arash and Leonard to use it.
* Visualizer: For the simulation visualizer, need:
  * DONE. need pull request for (pred) to add list of (sim). Pull request #109
  * need Sim to use model view instead of controller
    Difficult. Can we keep the controller in the C++ object, but use the model in the decompiled (sim) code?
      YES, TRY IT.

2020-09-24
* OK. Visualizer: ball.goal.external has drive to set position by changing speed - a simple simulation.
* PTPX: What is "pass through"? It prevents auto focus from remembering inputs needed for PTPX.
  -> Don't know what "pass through" is. Presumably an optimization. Try to get AERA to work without it.

2020-10-01
* OK. Visualizer: initial simulator - overlay on main timeline.
* DONE. Review/merge pull request for list of sims in (pred) https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/109
* DONE. Review/merge pull request for full (sim) syntax https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/117

2020-10-08
* DONE. Rename speed to velocity.
* DONE. Why doesn't the PTPX see the (cmd) which made the position prediction fail?
    PTPX::reduce:666 if (i->input_ == Opcodes::Cmd) // no cmds as req lhs (because no bwd-operational); prefer: cmd->effect, effect->imdl.
    TRY COMMENTING OUT.
* Try to get AERA to work without "pass through".
  "Pass through" is to avoid the autofocus requirement for "relevance" to goals or predictions, without relevance no
  auto focus for the pattern extractor. What is the best way to learn patterns when no existing goals or predictions?

2020-10-22
* DONE. Review/merge pull request: Keep the same abduced sim object in forward simulation. https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/98
* OK. Try integer positions. It should learn models like position n to n+1, and an exception at end-of-travel.
  Hand-coded exception model works: The main model is not killed for failing. (Needed to offset babbling command.)
* Models from PTPX don't seem to use specific facts which caused the failure. Basic question of general vs. specific models.

2020-12-03
* DONE. In runtime_out, change "environment" to "I/O device"
* DONE. Review/merge pull request for all combinations of CSTOverlay https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/127

2020-12-23
* Simulator: Avoiding loops.
  * If there is a goal for (mk.val c position 1), should quit if a subgoal (mk.val c position 2)?
  * Subtler for (icst S0 |[] [h s]) and (icst S0 |[] [h c]). Not obvious if conflicting.
    (cst |[] []
       (fact (mk.val h essence hand :) T0: T1: : :)
       (fact (mk.val h attached s :) T0: T1: : :)
    (cst |[] []
       (fact (mk.val h essence hand :) T0: T1: : :)
       (fact (mk.val h attached c :) T0: T1: : :)

    But could mean non-conflicting:
    (cst |[] []
       (fact (mk.val h essence hand :) T0: T1: : :)
       (fact (mk.val s attached h :) T0: T1: : :)

* DONE. Review/merge pull request for is_out_of_range(now) in retrieve_simulated_imdl_fwd https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/113
* Summer school example
  * We got lucky the first few times. We only predict (cmd move [h -25]), then predict (mk.val s position 15) without simulating grabbing s?
  * Need to simulate future change of many state variables (not just one like paddle position).

2021-01-14
* Investigate when need to set the "weak requirement enabled" flag.
   * The code says, "wr_enabled: true if there is at least one wr stronger than at least one sr." Yet many places set 
     wr_enabled when there are no strong requirements.
   * The code modifies the wr_enabled flags of existing (imdl ...) objects. This is one of the few cases where the objects are
     not immutable. Maybe it makes sense to modify an existing object if it is only used in one processing path, but the simulator
     has many processing paths. So, it might not make sense to modify an object sharded among different simulator paths.
     Pull request to ignore wr_enabled when matching in the simulator https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/132
* How does an AERA agent make hypotheses about essence facts? (avoid https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/112)
  TRY. New proposal for using CSTOverlay in https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/issues/97 .

* DONE: Vizualizer: Add "Reset Position".
* DONE: Vizualizer: Always put the timestamps at the top of the screen.
* Strong requirement: Tried (fact (mk.val h gripper_power false) -> (|fact (mk.val s position P1:)
  * Simulator does have a MANDATORY branch, but I don't see how it creates a solution.
    TRY: Using (|fact (imdl)) as the right hand side and see if this can be used to create the mandatory solution.

2021-03-18
* DONE. Move injectFact, etc. into base class as injectFaceFromIoDevice, etc.
* DONE. Rename AGI summer school to "hand-grab-sphere"

2021-03-25
* Can AERA start simulating from a non-simulated (and non drive) goal?
  NO. Inject: (fact (goal (fact (mk.val h position 0)))
    PrimaryMDLController::reduce:1655 if (!goal->is_drive())
  Simulations are started by TopLevelMDLController. Only by models with a RHS drive.

* TRY copy/paste code to check references to fix: Using = in guard of composite state of model https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/issues/133
  I spent some time on this but it is not a simple copy/paste. I need to dig into how IPGMContext actually does object references.
* Can AERA start simulating from a non-simulated (and non drive) goal?
  CORRECTION: YES. PrimaryMDLController::reduce:1655 if (!goal->is_drive())
    is_drive() returns false if the goal has a simulation (created by commit).
    (fact (g
    oal (|fact (mk.val h power false) 0s:200ms:0us 0s:600ms:0us) (sim 0 0s:0ms:0us)))
