* DONE. Try temporarily disabling assumptions. PrimaryMDLController::assume:2080
* DONE. pong.discrete.cmd.external: Why does m_y0_plus prediction fail?
  InputLessPGMOverlay::inject_productions:459 injects a (fact (cmd) ...) of zero duration.
  This is used as input to cst_y2_minus instead of the one injected by pgm_cmd_move_y_minus.
  BindingMap::match_timings:712 reduces (fact (icst cst_y2_minus)) to zero duration to match it.
  This makes the (fact (imdl m_y2_minus)) zero duration also.
  Therefore the prediction from the RHS of the model is also zero duration.
    (fact (pred (fact (mk.val p1 position y1 :) 0s:600ms:0us 0s:600ms:0us) ::) ::)
  The PMonitor calls _Fact::match_timings_overlap which fails if no overlap.
  Possible solutions:
    * NO: Make mdl ignore LHS duration and predict RHS with explicit duration. (Requires changing pattern extractor)
    * NO: Make inject_productions offset the instantaneous (fact (cmd ...)) into the future.
    * YES: Make inject_productions give (fact (cmd ...)) a duration.
    * NO: Move responsibility to inject (fact (cmd ...)) from inject_productions to the external environment.
    * NO: In _Fact::match_timings_overlap, special case when one interval is zero duration.
* DONE. Is the failed prediction from the assumption shielded from decreasing mdl confidence? No.

2020-01-09

  Feb 2012: Major update to CSTController::reduce
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/commit/3c5b9be5f935d6783fb1d35d74ca7d19ad4be186#diff-0ff725f0ae881cefbad0064fc2eac950R236
  Changed:
    Code *target = goal->get_reference(0)->get_reference(0);
    if (target->code(0).asOpcode() == Opcodes::ICST ...
  to:
    _Fact *goal_target=goal->get_reference(0);
    if (goal_target->code(0).asOpcode() == Opcodes::ICst ...
  There is a missing get_reference(0), so it never matches.
  Also, the following is clearly a bug, using the uninitialized bm:
    P<BindingMap> bm = new BindingMap(bm);
  Thus, the code to create goals from an abduced icst never ran after Feb 2012.
* DONE. HLPBindingMap::init_from_f_ihlp:1011 Fix to get the time stamp structure.
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/46
* Need CSTController::inject_goal:449 new View saliency 9999
  How does AERA choose among possible actions?

2020-01-17
* DONE. Make a pull request for the fix to CSTController::reduce. Merged.
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/47
* DONE. What was CSTController::inject_goal:449 resilience before the "big commmit" Feb 2012?
  There is code to compute the resilience, but seems to always use 1.
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/blob/8260dc91c441c5b586663332741bd85242f3d2d9/r_exec/cst_controller.cpp#L92
  Should we try to use the duration until the goal's fact time stamp?
* DONE. In drive for y1 200ms later, why does it also eject cmd move_y_minus?
  Because extra move commands are ignored, but registered anyway, did a model learn wrongly from that? NO.
  The goal for (mk.val p1 position y1) also matches m_y2_minus, and cst_y2_minus
    abduces the goal (cmd move_y_minus [p1] :), even though position is not y2.
* DONE. Is replicode now making simulations?
  NO. In settings.xml, min_sim_time_horizon==max_sim_time_horizon==0.
  Will change max_sim_time_horizon.
* pong.2.goal.replicode model building.
  ASTController<U>::ASTController:89 target is the premise, i.e. the tpx' target to be "defeated".
  Fix typo in comment: https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/commit/cde840d45a73c2826f7564d8a41b2732ed2ea88f
  CTPX::find_guard_builder "5 forms"
  InputLessPGMOverlay::inject_productions:461 Add GetTimeTolerance or use SYNC_HOLD so it can be a cause.

2020-01-21
* DONE pong.2.goal.replicode: Why does it need the initial speed_y?
  Because the patterns extractor CTPX::reduce needs a "cause", and this is the only fact available.
* CTPX::reduce: Discard inputs that don't share values with the consequent OR target.
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/48

2020-01-28
* DONE. Added "glue" output, e.g.
  fact (4652) imdl mdl 106 matches evidence fact (3962) imdl mdl 106
* Wrong: fact_130:(fact (icst cst_105 |[] [p1 y1 y1]) 0s:600ms:0us 0s:700ms:0us)
  Starts from consequent (fact y1_is_a_discrete_position1 0s:600ms:0us 0s:700ms:0us)

2020-01-31
* DONE. Finish gotcha: Documentation omits the 1 at the end of every object definition.
* CSTController::reduce:380 should ++o ? https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/commit/fc5961a4fa9f44d40298381bbdf86f314a9f26ab#diff-0ff725f0ae881cefbad0064fc2eac950R318
* DONE: pong.discrete.cmd.external: When adding fact 119 to fact_127, why is patterns already down to 2 used members?
    Because CSTOverlay::get_offspring transfers(?) from patterns to inputs.
  When building fact 113 icst[96][ 102 108 109 111], why does it use all 4 inputs?
    Because it comes from CSTOverlay(1331) which was never an offspring.
    Why no prediction? Because job 466 deletes model 98, so fact_113 is not used.

2020-02-07
* DONE. Create pull request for CSTController::reduce:380 should ++o
  https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/49
* DEFER. Does replicode v1.1 instantiate a cst from partial inputs?
  Don't know. The code is too different, and can't find tests that use pattern extractor.
* DONE. Make pong.discrete.cmd.external build the same models in diagnostic time.
  CSTOverlay::reduce:277 if (inputs.size() == original_patterns_size) inject_production();
  Almost: mdl 122 makes unbound predictions, e.g. fact_171
* Does pong.discrete.cmd.external use the learned models to abduce from the drive?
  NO. PrimaryMDLController::abduce:1609 abduction_allowed(bm) == false
  Maybe partly due to the bug in scan_variable: https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/50

2020-02-13

  ANSWER: Not much change. E.g. fact_558 goal imdl injected just the same.
* DONE. Review and merge https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/53 .
* DONE. In hand-coded model, why doesn't it (goal (fact (imdl)))?
  PrimaryMDLController::abduce:1636 retrieve_imdl_bwd returns NO_R (no requirements)
    -> directly to abduce LHS
  For mdl_98 from CTPX, MDLController constructor sets _is_requirement=WR (weak requirement)
* OK. Review issue to rename for readability https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/issues/55

2020-02-23
* DONE. Merge pull request for readability issue https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/issues/55
* DONE. Review issue to remove unused parameter https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/issues/57
* Changes in pong.discrete.cmd.external to abduce a goal from learned models:
  * Still need pull request https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/48
  * Still need CSTOverlay::reduce:288 to require all inputs for an icst.
  * Offset (fact (cmd)) to allow it to be a cause. https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/59
  * Delay the drive to allow predicting the imdl as a requirement. https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/commit/3339d3a804a32d1692b993777d1da87d3035a787
  * In m_run_position, offset the timestamp of the goal position by 90000us 
    so that v2 in mdl_93 exactly matches 3s:200ms:0us in the requirement
    (imdl mdl_93 [y1 3s:100ms:0us 3s:200ms:0us] [p1 y2 v5]) .
    (Need to find a way to make this flexible.)
  * Force HLPBindingMap::match_bwd_timings to succeed.
    The requirement timestamps 3s:100ms:0us,3s:200ms:0us don't match
    the mdl_93 RHS backward timestamps 3s:200ms:0us,3s:300ms:0us .
    It works if we use the timestamps of f_pattern (the constructed imdl).
  * In HLPOverlay::check_fwd_timings:178, need to evaluate fwd_after
    "v4:(sub v2 0s:80ms:0us)" first because fwd_before 
    "v5:(add v4 0s:30ms:0us)" depends on it.
    In general, there may be dependencies among many guards, so the general solution
    needs multiple passes to bind other assignment variables that may be dependencies.
    Maybe do ScanBWDGuards first and let it bind variables?

2020-02-25
* DONE. Review/merge allowing a reference to an expression https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/58
* REVIEW. pong.discrete.cmd.external: Fix learned model for move_y_minus position1->position2.

2020-03-12
* DONE. pong.discrete.cmd.external: Increase to 10 positions.
* DONE. In unfixed pong.discrete.cmd.external, when the goal to achieve position y0 is not achieved,
  what does the goal monitor do?
  ANSWER: Makes |fact_845:(|fact (success fact_825 fact_832) ...)
    but no further reduction jobs process it.
* DONE. Is PTPX invoked when a prediction fails?
  ANSWER: Yes, but does nothing. PTPX::reduce needs inputs, but nothing adds them.
  Makes |fact_234:(|fact (success fact_226 fact_232) ...)
  std.replicode:166 Need to set ctpx_on true.
  settings.xml: Need to set tpx_time_horizon?
* DONE. Is GTPX invoked when drive goal succeeds?
  ANSWER: Yes, but does nothing. GTPX::reduce needs inputs, but AutoFocusController::reduce:392
    doesn't call dispatch because std.replicode:166 pass_through is true.
    Setting pass_through false: No auto focus, no learned models, no AutoFocus.goals. Still no dispatch.
* DONE. Review/merge fix for getting fwd_after_index https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/63

* DONE. Merge pull request, need to increment iterator https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/53
* DONE. Is GMonitor::commit called?
  ANSWER: Yes, but sim_successes is empty because store_simulated_outcome is never called. 
  * It might be called from GMonitor::reduce but only after calling get_simulation(controller),
    which I can't believe was ever tested because it would crash due to the bug reported in
    https://github.com/IIIM-IS/CoreLibrary/pull/3 .
  * FIXED. Also, the code in store_similated_outcome never adds to sim_successes.optional_solutions . 
    _GMonitor::store_simulated_outcome:112
    (Hard to believe this code was tested.)
  * FIXED. Also, GMonitor::commit:217 uses (*sol).second, not best_sol. (Copy/paste error?)
  * MAYBE NOT A PROBLEM. Also, GMonitor::commit:219 may not use sim_successes.mandatory_solutions if there is no 
    best_sol from sim_successes.optional_solutions .

* DONE. Review/merge pull request for tabs to spaces https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/69
* DONE. In normal prediction, is there a Sim attached? Does it predict past the next sampling period? Need a drive?
  ANSWER: Apparently, no. The Pred object simulations is empty. The Sim constructor is only called when abducing from the drive.
* DONE. Review merged pull request to rename to sim_time_horizon_factor https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/68
* Review/merge pull request for GMonitor sim_thz https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/70
* More simulation issues:
  * min_sim_time_horizon is really "time allowance for the simulated predictions". PMDLController::get_sim_thz:1118
  * In get_sim_thz, Sim::thz and _GMonitor::sim_thz, "time horizon" means only abduction w/o prediction (min_sim_thz).
  * TopLevelMDLController::abduce_lhs:1228 makes Sim where sim_thz already has subtracted min_sim_thz. Then,
    PrimaryMDLController::abduce:1623 divides this by 2 and subtracts min_sim_thz again.
  * GMonitor::commit:217 bindings belongs to top model, but abduce called on another model - mismatch.

  * DONE. need pull request for (pred) to add list of (sim). Pull request #109
  * need Sim to use model view instead of controller
    Difficult. Can we keep the controller in the C++ object, but use the model in the decompiled (sim) code?
      YES, TRY IT.

2020-09-24
* OK. Visualizer: ball.goal.external has drive to set position by changing speed - a simple simulation.
* PTPX: What is "pass through"? It prevents auto focus from remembering inputs needed for PTPX.

* DONE. Rename speed to velocity.
* DONE. Why doesn't the PTPX see the (cmd) which made the position prediction fail?
    PTPX::reduce:666 if (i->input_ == Opcodes::Cmd) // no cmds as req lhs (because no bwd-operational); prefer: cmd->effect, effect->imdl.
    TRY COMMENTING OUT.
* Try to get AERA to work without "pass through".
  "Pass through" is to avoid the autofocus requirement for "relevance" to goals or predictions, without relevance no
  auto focus for the pattern extractor. What is the best way to learn patterns when no existing goals or predictions?

2020-10-22
* DONE. Review/merge pull request: Keep the same abduced sim object in forward simulation. https://github.com/IIIM-IS/replicode/pull/98
* OK. Try integer positions. It should learn models like position n to n+1, and an exception at end-of-travel.
  Hand-coded exception model works: The main model is not killed for failing. (Needed to offset babbling command.)
* Models from PTPX don't seem to use specific facts which caused the failure. Basic question of general vs. specific models.

* Investigate when need to set the "weak requirement enabled" flag.
   * The code says, "wr_enabled: true if there is at least one wr stronger than at least one sr." Yet many places set 
     wr_enabled when there are no strong requirements.
   * The code modifies the wr_enabled flags of existing (imdl ...) objects. This is one of the few cases where the objects are
     not immutable. Maybe it makes sense to modify an existing object if it is only used in one processing path, but the simulator
     has many processing paths. So, it might not make sense to modify an object sharded among different simulator paths.

* Can AERA start simulating from a non-simulated (and non drive) goal?

    fact_420 (ball pos) => make ASTController w/ candidate CTPX. fact_446 cmd => mdl 122 make fact_447 (predict ball pos).
      fact_447 => ASTController match target fact_420. ASTController::reduce:138 kill()
  * DONE. CTPX: mdl_269 is the same as mdl_122. Why re-learned? (Was labelled low-priority but now clear.)
    fact_446 cmd => mdl 122 does not predict ball pos, blocked by new bad mdl_168 (not killed yet).
      So the ASTController for the CTPX that makes mdl_269 is not killed (as above).
    But... ModelBase::MEntry::match is broken. When fixed, check_existence does prevent making mdl_269.

* Activation and saliency
  * DONE. ball.external: Why are some activation values -1.57772e-30 and -nan? These are less that 0, so is it not active?
    ANSWER: There are different types of View. The View on an icst doesn't use the activation, so it is not initialized.
    View(sync, ijt, sln, res, host, origin, object) // regular view
  * DONE. ball.external: Why are some activation values 1 as expected? (Different initialization code?)
    ANSWER: Yes, different View constructor.

    * Discuss: PTPX "Explain prediction failure" and GTPX "Explain goal achievement". Why not "Explain goal failure"? Maybe "Predict goal success" and that failure invokes PTPX?
    * Discuss: PTPX can find exceptions and make anti-requirement. (fact sphere_and_cube_same_position) -> (|fact (imdl grab)). If failure is due to missing preconditions,
      can PTPX find and add more? E.g.: (|fact power_light_on) -> (|fact (imdl grab)). Requires searching memory of past success or waiting for future success.
    * Discuss: "Measurement error" means the model is good but the conflicting "evidence" is wrong. Need to explain inference errors leading to the wrong measurement.
      Likewise, "Setup error" means the model and result measurement are good but the system was not actually in the prerequisite state used for the prediction. Need to explain and correct.

next meeting
* AERA in Ubuntu
  * Make TCP/Webots work. 
  * Fix Linux CriticalSection. (Use C++11 std::mutex?)
* Open issues from Leonard
  * Is allowed_shared_timing_vars still necessary? https://github.com/IIIM-IS/AERA/pull/110#issuecomment-1734308936
  * Standardization of ready command https://github.com/IIIM-IS/AERA/issues/155
  * Include possibility to inject multi-dimensional marker values https://github.com/IIIM-IS/AERA/issues/254
  * Zombie code found https://github.com/IIIM-IS/AERA/issues/273
  * Delta calculation for matching of delta in CTPX should be done with context operators https://github.com/IIIM-IS/AERA/issues/275
  * Matching in binding maps should be done on structures if possible https://github.com/IIIM-IS/AERA/issues/276
* Next meeting with Francesca et al
  * Need help with "exclusive" operator
  * Need help with extending abagraph with preferences
  * Need help with "is X a member of set S" with unbound constraint variables
  * Need help with incremental graph updates on all of the above
* blocks example
  * Change cmd("move", L1, L2) to the more "AERA-like" cmd("move", deltaP)
  * Use var for timestamps and T2 = T0 + 100. Remove "succ" relation.
  * Demonstrate multiple solutions if there are more intermediate positions.

* Cook up an example where backward chaining for a counterexample finds the same information as forward chaining from the current state (friend has brought dinner)
* Cook up an argumention example showing multiple levels of competing goals, and constructivist levels.
* hand-grab-sphere
  * Make AERA take experimenting actions to test candidate PTPX models (instead of seed commands).
  * Try to get GTPX to learn mdl_displace_hand by making it a goal to not be at a position and observe what achieves it.
    * In abduce, ignore negative match of the RHS.
* Webots
  * Make pull request to align Webots aera_us with AERA time (after testing in real time mode). [Jeff]
  * Reset aera_us when resetting the environment.
  * Try Webots streaming to the Visualizer [Chloe]
  * Get command efferent copy from Webots (move limit to +/- 20) [Maybe in the setup message or command reply. Need more discussion]

TODO
* PTPX: Learned cst may only have icsts. But using a cst for later model-building requires a non-icst fact. Should icst->contains be recursive? (Need limit.) Or always include a fact in new_cst?
* Pong
  * Add paddle. Make goal for the ball to be at a position which requires moving the paddle to bounce it.
  * Remove cst_ball_position, etc. and learn them.
  * Learn the exception "bounce" model.
* Try commenting out PTPX::reduce:666 if (i->input_ == Opcodes::Cmd)
* Visualizer: Option to position simulation objects by predicted time vs. created time.
* Visualizer: Show the time job queue sorted by time.
* If min_sim_time_horizon > 0, how is the behavior different?
* Issue #2: Try to reproduce.
* Issue #25: Reproduce running in real-time, and see if it happens in diagnostic time.
